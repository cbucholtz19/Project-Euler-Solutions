Problem 6:

The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385
The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

(1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 55^2 = 3025
Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first
ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first
one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.

[SOLUTION]
'''

def sumOfSquares(n):
    a = 0
    for i in range(1, n+1):

    return a

    a = int((n*(n+1)/2))
    return a**2
